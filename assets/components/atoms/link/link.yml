title: Link
name: link
notes: >
  A link is styled by default with a red underline (on [supported
  browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=text-decoration), otherwise, the underline
  uses the text color).


  A `link-pretty` class can be used to create a better and more cross-browser
  style.

  A `link-collapse` class sets the link to have a red triangle and special styles.
