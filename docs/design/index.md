# Design principles

## Elements is the living design documentation for the EPFL ecosystems.

<br>

> Our goal is to grow a single design system that supports a unified experience across all of the EPFL platforms. To achieve this, we articulate our design toolkit around 3 master principles: **clarity**, **balance** & **modularity**.

<br>

## Clarity

We communicate with transparency, we want to make sure that our message is clear and understood. We achieve clarity through intentional choices. Picking elements that sustain our goals and values. Clarity is, for us, connected to accessibility.

## Balance

We talk to many people from different profiles and backgrounds and we want to serve this diversity. We achieve balance through rational decisions on what we know and what we need to communicate. Assembling elements with harmony in mind.

## Modularity

Our practices are vast and rich. Our design system offers a set of components we group like building blocks. We achieve consistency no matter the size and shapes of those pieces. Selecting the appropriate elements to create unity. This versatility is an echo of our ability to innovate.

## 3
Three is our magic number: it reflects our missions: Education, Innovation & Research. And when you pronounce it the French way, it sounds like “free“.

Elements component hierarchy is based on **[Atomic Design Principles](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)**. It really means that User Interface is made with various sized components.
